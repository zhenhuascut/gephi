Code for GRA algorithm. Visualizing complex networks by leveraging community structures.

GRA is the state-of-the-art visualizing or layout algorithm for complex networks or communties. The alogrithm can be used to visualize almost any types of networks or communities. Feel free to ask any questions if you meet.

In our method, the force weights are adaptively calculated between nodes by taking communities impacts into consideration, facilitating to produce a much better visualization.
The method in the paper can be used in various kinds of complex network tasks, such as community visualization, informatics network visualization, and information propagation analysis, etc. We verify our method on networks of different sizes and density.
The method can be used to visualize very large networks up to 100000 nodes at a very higher performance compared to strong baselines.
We proposed a visualization metric that utilizes multivariate Gaussian distributions to estimate the areas of communities and evaluate the quality of visualization by fitting core areas of communities. The metric works well in evaluating the community structured visualization.
